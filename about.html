    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from Kyiv, Ukraine</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        I've started my jorney in codding not so many time ago. But I'm still
        exiting about this. It's so great to understand that you are able to
        create such inspirating and incredible things as web-sites, different
        applications.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you still have any doubts about is it yours or no - just do it;) It's
        the only way to understand if you need it! Also hightly I reccomend
        SheCodes's Workshops for this purpose!
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides coding I'm going for sport, keen on dealing with figures,
        travelling. I'm working as an accountant but it's not juas a job, it's
        inside me. I like my job although for other it seeems to be boring!
        <br />
        <br />
        The same adrenaline i feel in the gym while doing my exersises. It's
        time for me for thinking and calming down!
